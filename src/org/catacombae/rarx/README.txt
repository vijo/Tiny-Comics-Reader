Acknowledgements
----------------

This code has been written with the UniquE RAR File Library v0.4.0 as a reference.
Thus the author of this library should have a lot of credit for enabling me to write this code.
I have not attributed him in the source files, as they have been written by myself in Java after
studying the details of the UniquE implementation (in C), but here's a more general attribution;
This would not have been possible without the GPL:d work of Christian Scheurer!
